# 👨‍💻 Anthony Inzinna | Technical Research & Code Archive

**M.S. Data Science (Candidate) | Python & R Developer**

This profile serves as the source code repository for my applied research in behavioral analytics and algorithmic forecasting. Unlike my business portfolio, this archive focuses on the **raw implementation logic**, reproducibility, and statistical methodologies used in my modeling work.

## 📂 Repository Index & Technical Stacks

### 1. [Employee Retention Modeling (XGBoost & SHAP)](https://github.com/anthonyinzinna/People-Analytics-Behavioral-Drivers)
**Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, SHAP
* **Implementation:** Developed a classification pipeline using `scale_pos_weight` to handle class imbalance in HR data.
* **Logic:** Replaced standard black-box predictions with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) waterfall plots to quantify individual turnover risk factors.
* **Key Function:** Optimized precision-recall thresholds to improve minority class detection (attrition) from 34% to 61%.

### 2. [Supply Chain Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/anthonyinzinna/Retail-Inventory-Forecasting-Prophet)
**Stack:** Python, Facebook Prophet, Pandas
* **Implementation:** Time-series decomposition model separating growth trends from weekly/yearly seasonality.
* **Logic:** Calculated dynamic "Safety Stock" levels using 95% confidence interval upper bounds rather than static averages.
* **Outcome:** Generated risk-adjusted procurement algorithms to minimize stockout probabilities during high-variance periods.

### 3. [Geospatial Visualization Pipeline](https://github.com/anthonyinzinna/Data_Viz_Urban_Growth)
**Stack:** R, Magick, Tmap
* **Implementation:** Custom "Manual Device" rendering pipeline to bypass standard library limitations on ARM64 architectures.
* **Logic:** Script generates individual PNG frames for urban density evolution (1950–2030) and stitches them using the Magick image processing engine.
* **Feature:** Hardware-agnostic rendering loop for high-resolution time-lapse generation.

### 4. [Mobile Game A/B Testing Analysis](https://github.com/anthonyinzinna/Mobile-Game-Retention-AB-Test)
**Stack:** Python, SciPy, Statistical Hypothesis Testing
* **Implementation:** rigorous evaluation of gameplay gate mechanics (Level 30 vs Level 40).
* **Logic:** Applied statistical significance testing (p-value analysis) to measure impacts on 1-Day vs 7-Day retention rates.
* **Result:** Quantified the negative impact of delayed friction points on long-term user habituation.
